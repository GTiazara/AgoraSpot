                    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures

                        or
                        information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
                        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
                        defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
                        we
                        will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to

                            href="https://app.termly.io/notify/20c328c0-db0f-4b7d-bef6-4a1cb154f690"

                    <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a
                        request
                        on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that
                        they
                        have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

                    <h3>Request Verification</h3>
                    <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same
                        person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal information
                        provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if
                        we
                        cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that
                        you
                        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
                        fraud-prevention purposes.</p>

                    <p>If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional
                        information
                        to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a
                        written
                        and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.</p>

                    <h3>Appeals</h3>
                    <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request,
                        you
                        may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a
                            href="mailto:tiazaragaetan@gmail.com">tiazaragaetan@gmail.com</a>. We will inform you in
                        writing
                        of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of
                        the
                        reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your state
                        attorney general.</p>
